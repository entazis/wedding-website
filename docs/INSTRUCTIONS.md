# Design our wedding website

The wedding website should generally have a clean, elegant, and personalized design to reflect the our style and vibe. It should include key information and various engaging sections to inform and delight guests. Here is what these websites commonly look like and include:

## Look and Style

- Clean, modern, or romantic aesthetics with soft tones, pastels, or colors matching the wedding theme.
- Large, attractive photos, often full-screen header images of the couple.
- Personalized design elements such as floral logos, monograms, or custom fonts.
- Easy navigation, sometimes with sticky or vertical menus for smooth browsing.
- Sections with cohesive visual harmony linking back to the wedding theme or
location, e.g., destination wedding vibes with island-inspired colors.
